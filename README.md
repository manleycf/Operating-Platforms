Briefly sumamrizae The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a company that currently runs a web-based game on Android that involves players looking a picture slowly loaded and guessing what the picture is. The client wanted to expand the availability of the game to other operating systems, such as Windows and iOS.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe my greatest strength when developing this documentation was making sure my Executive Summary, Requirements, Design Constraints, and Domain Model sections were clear, easy to understand, and relevant.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The most helpful aspect of creating the design document, in my opinion, was the gathering of information into one place. This allowed me to have one single point of reference that I needed to check while working on the code.

IF you could choose one part of your work on these decuments to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would go into more specifics on the differences between the operating systems in the Evaluation section to properly convey the benefits and drawbacks of each one.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

I tried to base my entire design on making sure the user's needs were efficiently and effectively met. It is critical to consider user needs when designing because even an efficient and functional system is worthless if it fails to meet the needs of your client, and this outcome's likelihood increases the more you put off focusing on the user's needs.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach to designing software begins with identifying the end goals of the product. From there, I can begin to plan out a solution to each problem, while continuously revisiting and revising to ensure compliance with the end goals. One technique I find very useful is the use of diagrams to depict a system. Using diagrams allows me to view the system from a specific perspective, and this combined with the visual aid that diagrams provide helps me ensure that I fully understand the system.
